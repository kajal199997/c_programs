# Logical operators
# OR Gate // if any true value there result is true
# A B C
# 0 0 0
# 1 0 1
# 0 1 1
# 1 1 1
# C operator (||)
# e.g A || B || C || D || E 
#
#
# AND Gate // if both values are true result is true
# A B C
# 0 0 0
# 1 0 0
# 0 1 0
# 1 1 1
# C operator (&&)
# e.g A && B
#
# NOT Gate // if true then false if false then true
# A  C
# 0  1
# 1  0
# C operator (!)
# e.g !A , !B
#
# Assertions
# 1st Assertion - Every non zero vale will be treated as true in C
# 2nd Assertion - if any of the value is true (||) will result true
# 3rd Assertion - if both values are true (&&) will result true
